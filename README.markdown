This is a CSS "module" essentially consisting of an image (a sprite image) and a stylesheet for you to add nice little icons to the right of hyperlinks that lead to a file with a certain extension. Find examples in index.html.

Installation

For production, simply use the hyperlink_icons.css as a stylesheet and make sure that it is referencing the sprite.gif image correctly. This should make links look like the examples in index.html
